Overview: The DYAMOND LLC2160 Ocean Simulation is a global, petabyte‑scale “nature run” of the ocean at 1/24° (~4 km) horizontal resolution with 90 vertical levels, produced with MITgcm as part of the DYAMOND (Phase II) high‑resolution atmosphere–ocean initiative. Spanning 14+ months with hourly output (10,366 time steps from 2020‑01‑20 to 2021‑03‑26), it resolves mesoscale eddies and much of the submesoscale in energetic regions, making it a uniquely rich resource for studying ocean boundary layers, eddy–front dynamics, and air–sea interaction in a controlled, observation‑like setting.

Key variables:
- Temperature (°C): Tracks ocean heat content and stratification, essential for mixed‑layer depth, buoyancy, and heat budget analyses.
- Salinity (g kg‑1): Complements temperature to determine density, freshwater flux impacts, and barrier layers affecting mixing.
- Velocity (u, v, w components): Captures horizontal currents and vertical motions driving transport, eddy kinetic energy, upwelling/downwelling, and vertical exchange.

Spatial & temporal coverage: Global ocean on the LLC2160 grid (8640 × 6480 × 90) with georeferencing provided (llc2160_latlon.nc) and hourly temporal resolution. The record covers January 2020 through March 2021, including the widely used DYAMOND winter 40‑day window (Jan 20–Feb 28, 2020) and an extended seasonal cycle, enabling analyses from diurnal variability and storm events to submesoscale fronts and seasonal transitions—coverage that is rarely available at this resolution.

Scientific applications: Ideal for investigating eddy–front interactions, mixed‑layer restratification, vertical exchange and ventilation, heat/salt budgets, and Lagrangian transport pathways; for benchmarking satellite algorithms and designing in‑situ observing systems; and for coupled air–sea studies alongside the companion GEOS 6‑km atmosphere fields. The DYAMOND team highlights that this hourly, high‑resolution “nature” simulation is being shared to support boundary‑layer science and observing system design, with animations and quick‑look visualizations available via NASA portals—making this dataset a powerful testbed for process studies and model–observation synergy at the scales satellites begin to resolve.
