What we found (single snapshot, surface-only). At 2020-02-01 00:00 UTC (timestep 288 from the DYAMOND LLC2160 run), the surface salinity of the Red Sea shows the expected strong meridional gradient: fresher water entering from the south near Bab-el-Mandeb and steadily increasing salinity toward the northern Gulfs. Over the ocean-only portion of the selected subdomain, the statistics are:
- Mean 39.319 g kg-1
- Min 35.924 g kg-1
- Max 43.286 g kg-1
- Standard deviation 1.075 g kg-1
- Percentiles: p10 37.794, p25 38.771, p50 (median) 39.403, p75 40.170, p90 40.284, p95 40.351, p99 42.633 g kg-1

The distribution is unimodal and tightly clustered around 39–40 g kg-1, with a fresher tail that pulls the mean slightly below the median (consistent with advection of lower-salinity water from the Gulf of Aden) and very salty but spatially limited hotspots at the far north (driving the p99 ~42.6 g kg-1 and the overall maximum ~43.3 g kg-1). The spatial map (plot_1_20251202_181223.png) makes this northward increase and localized high-salinity patches visually clear. The histogram (plot_2_20251202_181223.png) and percentile summary (plot_3_20251202_181223.png) quantify that most of the basin sits in a narrow 38.8–40.2 g kg-1 band, with light tails to both lower and higher values.

How we scoped and executed the query. The dataset spans 2020-01-20 to 2021-03-26 at hourly resolution (10366 timesteps). I chose a single hourly snapshot on 2020-02-01 00:00 UTC to meet the “any timestep” requirement while keeping I/O modest. We extracted the surface layer only (z_range [0,1]) over a Red Sea bounding box defined by model index ranges x=[1680,1968) and y=[4274,4779) which correspond to approximately 12.03°N–29.97°N, 32.02°E–43.98°E. The read operated at full spatial fidelity (quality=0). Because this rectangular box includes substantial land, I applied a precomputed land–ocean mask aligned to the same grid and retained only ocean cells for statistics. The resulting data array contained 145,440 grid cells in the subdomain, of which 24,743 were ocean points used in the analysis. All metrics (min, max, mean, standard deviation, histogram with 40 bins, and percentiles at 10/25/50/75/90/95/99) were computed over those ocean-only values.

Connecting the query to the visualizations. The map directly answers the “spatial map for that timestep” request and shows where salinity is high/low across the basin. It also helps interpret the distribution: the lower-end tail in the histogram corresponds to the southern entrance, and the sparse high-end tail corresponds to localized evaporative hotspots in the far north (Gulfs of Suez and Aqaba region). The histogram then summarizes how much of the basin occupies particular salinity bands, while the percentiles translate that distribution into robust summary statistics familiar to oceanographers (e.g., the interquartile range and extreme quantiles). Taken together, the map gives geographical context, and the histogram/percentiles quantify spread and tails—two complementary views of the same snapshot.

Key patterns and context. The north–south gradient is the dominant signal, similar to observations and previous modeling work in the Red Sea: exchange with the Gulf of Aden supplies relatively fresh water to the south, while strong net evaporation and restricted circulation elevate salinity to the north. The small interquartile range (p25–p75 ≈ 1.40 g kg-1) shows that most of the domain is tightly clustered; the marked jump from p95 (~40.35) to p99 (~42.63) highlights that very salty features are spatially limited but intense. The mean below the median indicates a slight left skew driven by southern fresher waters.

Estimated accuracy and performance, grounded in empirical benchmarks. This run used quality=0 (full-resolution). In the empirical performance CSV, multiple single-timestep, quality=0 reads report RMSE=0.0 and 0% error relative to the source for the tested variable at similar configurations (e.g., CSV rows 0, 6, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39). Extrapolating to salinity at the same quality level, the expected accuracy relative to the stored dataset is effectively exact. Conservatively, we can state the estimated accuracy is better than ±1% (±0.4 g kg-1) with a safety margin; in practice, error is dominated by floating-point numerics and masking, not by any downsampling or approximation.

For time-to-solution, we scale from a comparable surface-only, single-timestep, quality=0 read in the CSV: row 33 shows 734,672 points read in 3.919 seconds, which is 0.065 minutes. Our query read 145,440 points (about 19.8% of that), implying roughly 0.78 seconds, i.e., 0.013 minutes, for the raw data read. A second reference at global surface scale, row 39, is 55,987,200 points in 38.346 seconds (0.639 minutes), which would imply about 0.10 seconds (0.002 minutes) for our footprint under ideal scaling. Adding modest overhead for masking, statistics, and plotting, the end-to-end runtime remains on the order of a few seconds, well under 0.5 minutes in practice.

Limitations and next steps. This is a single surface snapshot; we did not analyze vertical structure (e.g., halocline, mixing), seasonal progression, or mesoscale variability over time. The rectangular bounding box includes coastline and land; while the ocean mask removes land from the statistics, any sub-grid coastal complexities or very narrow passages may still be simplified by the model grid. If desired, we can (i) extend to a time series to quantify variability and trends; (ii) examine depth sections to characterize stratification and water mass transformation; and (iii) co-analyze temperature and velocity to link salinity anomalies to circulation and air–sea flux regimes.

Files and reproducibility. The plots plot_1_20251202_181223.png (map), plot_2_20251202_181223.png (histogram), and plot_3_20251202_181223.png (percentiles) correspond to the above results. The analysis used salinity from mit_output/llc2160_salt at timestep 288 (2020-02-01 00:00:00 UTC), with x=[1680,1968), y=[4274,4779), z=[0,1), quality=0, and an ocean mask aligned to the same grid.
