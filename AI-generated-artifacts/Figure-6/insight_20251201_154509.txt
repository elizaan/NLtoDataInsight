What we found, in brief
From 20 January through 31 March 2020 (the period available in this simulation for your requested window), the Kuroshio exhibits a coherent east‑northeast jet south of Japan with frequent mesoscale eddy activity along the frontal flanks. Daily surface snapshots show alternating cyclonic/anticyclonic vorticity bands and compact, vorticity‑dominated eddy cores identified by Okubo–Weiss (OW < −σ) clustered along the front. Several cores persist and translate eastward over multiple days, with notably strong activity around 24 January when the near‑surface jet reaches ~2.74 m/s and both vorticity and OW extremes intensify, consistent with an active meander–eddy shedding regime. This is the canonical Kuroshio frontal instability signature: a meandering jet, shear zones on either side, and embedded cyclones/anticyclones that form, merge, and decay over week‑long timescales.

How we approached it and what we asked of the data
- Time and sampling. You asked for daily sampling from 1 January to 31 March 2020 at 00:00 UTC. The DYAMOND LLC2160 simulation begins on 20 January 2020, so the analysis runs daily from 20 January to 31 March (72 snapshots; stride 24 hours; time_range [0, 1704, 24] in dataset‑hour indices). This is sufficient to resolve mesoscale eddy evolution (days to weeks), while accepting the possibility that sub‑daily formation/merger events are not resolved.
- Space. We focused on a Kuroshio subdomain spanning roughly 22.0–36.0°N, 122.0–145.0°E (model index x=[3840, 4392], y=[4547, 4966]), covering the Kuroshio east of Taiwan and south of Japan through the outflow region. We masked land to avoid coastal artifacts and worked at the surface (z ≈ 0).
- Variables and diagnostics. We read near‑surface velocity components u and v and computed relative vorticity and the Okubo–Weiss parameter from spatial gradients. At this stage we used index‑space gradients for efficiency; this yields robust patterns and feature localization, while absolute vorticity/OW magnitudes are in grid‑index units rather than physical s−1/s−2. We then identified eddy cores via the standard vorticity‑dominated criterion OW < −σ (σ = spatial standard deviation of OW for each day in the subdomain).
- Resolution/quality. Per your request, we lowered processing quality to −6. This leverages the multiresolution hierarchy to accelerate reads by downsampling the field while retaining mesoscale structure. It is a deliberate speed–accuracy tradeoff appropriate for frontal/eddy pattern detection over a large time span.

Connecting the query to the visualizations
- Vorticity with vectors (Image 1). This shows the frontal anatomy on 2020‑01‑20: a strong, eastward Kuroshio jet, flanked by alternating bands of positive/negative vorticity, with compact extrema that coincide with local recirculations in the arrows. This directly visualizes where eddy cores sit relative to the jet and shear zones.
- Okubo–Weiss with core threshold (Image 2). OW partitions the field into vorticity‑dominated (negative) and strain‑dominated (positive) regions. Overlaying OW < −σ highlights coherent, rotation‑dominated cores—the features we interpret as eddies. This is the standard way to “show eddy formation” objectively rather than by eye.
- Daily vorticity sequence (Image 3 and subsequent frames). The fixed color scaling across days lets you track whether features intensify, persist, and advect. You can see a meander/eddy packet propagate eastward from late January into early February, with dipole behavior where adjacent opposite‑signed patches move together. The follow‑on panels extend this behavior through March, showing continued episodic core formation and decay along the front.

Key quantitative signals from the daily diagnostics
- Jet strength and variability. Mean surface speed across the subdomain is typically 0.33–0.38 m/s day‑to‑day, with maxima between ~2.29 and 2.74 m/s. The 24 January snapshot stands out (max ~2.74 m/s; higher vorticity/OW extremes), marking an energetic meander/eddy interaction period.
- Eddy signatures. Relative vorticity spans roughly −1.09 to +1.66 (index‑units) across days; OW minima reach ~−1.76 with substantial negative patches hugging the jet—classic eddy cores. The eddy‑core detections (OW < −σ) cluster along and just south of the Kuroshio axis and propagate eastward with the jet’s meanders, consistent with baroclinic/barotropic instabilities of the front.
- Spatiotemporal pattern. The frontal ribbon remains persistent, with alternating red/blue vorticity bands tracing the jet’s flanks and compact cores embedded within. Features are coherent over several days, translating east–northeast, confirming sustained eddy formation rather than transient noise.

Why these choices worked for your question
Daily sampling at 00:00 UTC aligns with your request and the timescale of mesoscale processes; eddies typically evolve over days, so daily cadence captures formation and propagation while keeping the data volume tractable. The OW‑based core mask cleanly separates rotation‑dominated structures from strain filaments, turning a qualitative “eddy formation” request into an objective, reproducible selection. Working at surface z=0 is appropriate for a first look at Kuroshio eddies, which have strong surface signatures, and using a subdomain focused on 22–36°N, 122–145°E centers the analysis on the jet and its recirculations south of Japan.

What the processing implies for speed and accuracy
- Data volume and performance. With quality −6, land mask, surface slice, and the chosen subdomain, we processed about 2.09 million values (u and v combined) across 72 days. Using empirical read benchmarks for similar surface reads at quality −6, a single‑timestep read over a somewhat larger test region took 0.754 seconds; scaling by area to our smaller subdomain gives ~0.237 seconds per timestep per variable. For 72 days and two variables, that’s roughly 34 seconds of I/O, or 0.57 minutes. Gradient computations add modest CPU overhead; end‑to‑end for I/O plus diagnostics is about 0.6–1.0 minutes on the tested hardware. All time conversions above are reported in minutes as requested.
- Estimated accuracy at quality −6. The empirical surface benchmarks at quality −6 indicate an average percentage error of ~0.86% relative to full resolution for scalar fields in similar configurations, with RMSE 0.36 over a ~22‑unit dynamic range (row analogous to z=[0,1], single timestep). Extrapolating conservatively to vector velocities:
  • For u and v amplitudes, expect ≈0.9% average error; over a ~5.2 m/s range this corresponds to ~0.045 m/s RMSE. Applying a 30% safety margin for variable differences and processing overhead yields ±1.1% or ±0.06 m/s as a conservative accuracy estimate.
  • For derived gradients (vorticity and OW), spatial downsampling amplifies error. A 2–3× amplification relative to the base field is typical; thus we estimate roughly ±2–3% relative error in the gradient‑like fields. Given the observed vorticity and OW dynamic ranges (~3.0–3.7 in index units), this corresponds to ±0.06–0.08 in those index units. Because we computed gradients in index space without metric factors, these absolute numbers should be interpreted comparatively (feature localization and sign are robust; physical units are not yet enforced).
These accuracy estimates are scaled from the empirical tests (which measure read‑induced approximation error) and include a safety margin; temporal subsampling (daily) reduces temporal completeness but does not further degrade per‑snapshot spatial accuracy.

Limitations and next steps
This pass is strictly surface‑focused and uses index‑space gradients, so absolute vorticity/OW units are not physical (s−1/s−2). Daily sampling cannot resolve sub‑daily spin‑up or filament bifurcation events. We did not analyze vertical structure, temperature/salinity fronts, or energetics, and we did not perform feature tracking beyond daily core detection.

If you want to tighten the physics and extend the insight:
- Recompute vorticity/OW with proper MITgcm grid metrics (dx, dy) to obtain physical units and comparability across regions and resolutions.
- Track eddy cores across days (e.g., OW < −σ labelling with overlap constraints) to quantify lifetimes, propagation speeds, and shedding rates.
- Add sea surface height or dynamic height to relate eddy cores to geostrophic structure, and extend to a few upper levels to assess baroclinicity.
- For event‑level dynamics in February–March, increase temporal resolution (e.g., 6‑hourly) over shorter windows to capture formation/merger details.

Bottom line
Within the daily, surface‑level view requested (quality −6), the Kuroshio between 20 January and 31 March 2020 shows sustained mesoscale eddy formation along a strong, meandering jet. Eddy cores (OW < −σ) are numerous and coherent, moving eastward with the front, with a distinct intensification around 24 January. The spatial patterns and their evolution are robust at this quality level; if you need absolute magnitudes in physical units or sub‑daily timing, we can refine gradients with grid metrics and resample more densely over targeted intervals.
