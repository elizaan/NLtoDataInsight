What we asked and what we found
We extracted near-surface (z=0) temperature from the DYAMOND LLC2160 ocean simulation over the Indian Ocean domain (about 20°E–120°E, 50°S–30°N) for two representative hours in 2020: 2020-05-15 12:00 UTC (timestep 2796) and 2020-11-15 12:00 UTC (timestep 7212). At full resolution, the May snapshot shows a strong meridional gradient with cool waters south of ~35–40°S and warm waters in the tropics and northern basins (Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal), with many mesoscale fronts and eddies in the southwest. The November snapshot is also warm along the equator and northern rim, with pronounced mesoscale structure and a cool southern mid-latitude band. The Nov–May anomaly (Nov minus May) indicates basin-mean cooling of −0.87°C between these two dates, with localized regions of warming interspersed with broader areas of cooling. The strongest signed anomalies are in the eddy-rich southern mid-latitudes and parts of the western Indian Ocean; the equatorial and coastal zones show mixed sign anomalies.

Numbers at a glance
For May (2020-05-15 12:00 UTC): min 1.59°C, max 35.41°C, mean 22.26°C, std 8.23°C. Percentiles: p5 6.04°C, p25 16.24°C, p50 25.12°C, p75 29.26°C, p95 31.19°C.
For November (2020-11-15 12:00 UTC): min 0.92°C, max 34.25°C, mean 21.39°C, std 8.53°C. Percentiles: p5 5.22°C, p25 14.81°C, p50 23.76°C, p75 28.94°C, p95 31.22°C.
For the Nov–May anomaly (Nov minus May): min −9.77°C, max +8.89°C, mean −0.87°C, std 1.52°C. Percentiles: p5 −3.25°C, p25 −1.80°C, p50 −0.93°C, p75 +0.075°C, p95 +1.61°C.

These summary statistics tell a coherent story: the domain-wide median decreases from 25.1°C in May to 23.8°C in November, and the average anomaly is negative. The p75 of the anomaly is slightly positive (~0.075°C), which, together with a negative median, indicates that while a substantial portion of the domain cools (especially the central and southern sectors), there are pockets of warming that push the upper quartile close to neutral or weakly positive. The tails show large local swings (±9–10°C), consistent with energetic seasonal and mesoscale variability (upwelling/downwelling, mixed-layer depth changes, and frontal/eddy advection).

How we did it and why these choices
We used the DYAMOND LLC2160 theta (potential temperature) field via OpenVisus at full resolution (quality level Q=0). The model grid is 8640×6480×90; we subset the Indian Ocean in model index space x=[1392, 3792], y=[2457, 4779], and requested z=[0, 1], then extracted the surface (z=0) as a 2D map. The chosen geographic box corresponds to roughly 20.02°E–119.98°E and 49.99°S–29.97°N—this covers the core Indian basin and avoids the far Southern Ocean. Times were mapped from the dataset’s start (2020-01-20, hourly cadence) to two representative mid-month dates: May 15 and November 15 at 12:00 UTC, i.e., timesteps 2796 and 7212. This gives two clean seasonal endpoints without the need for temporal averaging and keeps the query cost low.

We applied an ocean mask where available; if the mask utility is unavailable, the script falls back to an “all ocean” mask. In practice, the read values did not exhibit fill-value artifacts along coasts, and the extrema remained physically plausible (0.9–35.4°C), so land contamination is unlikely to materially affect the statistics reported here. We computed domain statistics (min, max, mean, std), percentiles (5, 25, 50, 75, 95), and histograms with a common set of 50 bins for May and November; for the anomaly we used symmetric bins spanning ±max(|anomaly|). We processed 11,145,600 near-surface grid points in total (two timesteps over the 2D domain).

Why these plots, and how they map to your mental model
Two maps show the near-surface temperature structure for May and November, which directly answers “what does the surface look like?” at each date. The anomaly map (Nov–May) emphasizes where the surface warmed (positive) or cooled (negative) between late boreal spring and late boreal autumn, disentangling spatial patterns from the absolute background gradient. The histograms and percentiles summarize the basin-wide distribution—how much of the domain sits in particular temperature ranges, and how the distribution shifts between the two dates—complementing the maps’ spatial narrative with a quantitative, basin-integrated view.

Interpreting the patterns in physical context
The May map captures late boreal spring conditions with strong warming across the northern tropics and subtropics and a marked cool band in the southern mid-latitudes. The November map shows post–SW monsoon conditions in the north and late austral spring in the south; the overall distribution shifts slightly cooler (mean decreases from 22.26°C to 21.39°C; median from 25.12°C to 23.76°C), even though localized warm pools persist near the Maritime Continent and some northern coastal margins. The anomaly field’s spatial heterogeneity—the alternation of warm/cool filaments and eddies, and larger patches of negative anomaly—reflects the combined effects of seasonal mixed-layer changes, wind-driven upwelling (e.g., western boundary regions), horizontal advection by energetic mesoscale eddies, and frontal migration in the subtropical transition zone. The large positive and negative local anomalies (up to ~±9–10°C) are consistent with strong seasonal transitions and mesoscale processes at 1/27° resolution.

Accuracy and performance expectations (scaled from empirical tests)
We ran at full resolution (quality level Q=0). In the empirical benchmarks, Q=0 reads have rmse = 0 and percentage error = 0 because no spatial degradation is applied. For reference, a global near-surface single-timestep read (row 39 of the empirical table) took 38.35 seconds (about 0.64 minutes) for 55,987,200 points, with a dynamic range roughly −2.50°C to 33.06°C. Our per-timestep domain is about one-fifth of that (~5.6 million points), so a linear scaling suggests on the order of 4–8 seconds per timestep. With two timesteps plus analysis and I/O overhead, an end-to-end runtime of roughly 0.1–0.3 minutes is a reasonable estimate. Accuracy-wise, because Q=0 is lossless, the limiting factors are numerical precision and any mask/coastline handling. Conservatively, you can treat this as better than 1% error relative to the domain’s temperature range (roughly ±0.2–0.3°C as a safety bound), though in practice it is effectively exact for the underlying model outputs.

What we saved for reproducibility
We cached the arrays (May map, November map, anomaly), the mask, and the summary statistics, percentiles, and histogram counts/edges in a single NPZ: /Users/ishratjahaneliza/Documents/PhD/Valerio/codes/NLQtoDataInsight/agent6-web-app/ai_data/data_cache/dyamond_llc2160/data_20251202_190204.npz.

Limitations and what we did not analyze
These are single-hour snapshots, not monthly means; they capture instantaneous mesoscale structure and day-to-day weather but do not isolate the seasonal climatology. We restricted attention to the surface grid cell (z=0); we did not examine vertical structure, mixed-layer depth, or the role of salinity and velocity. The land–ocean mask utility may fall back to an all-ocean assumption if unavailable; given the reasonable extrema and spatial coherence, land contamination appears minimal in this subset, but narrow coastal artifacts cannot be entirely excluded. Finally, because we compared two dates directly, the reported “anomaly” is not de-seasonalized; regional signals may reflect both the climatological seasonal cycle and year-specific variability.

Next steps if you want more
If your goal is seasonal signals rather than day-to-day variability, we can compute monthly means for May and November and repeat the map and anomaly analysis. To connect anomaly patterns to dynamics, we can overlay surface velocity and wind stress or compute mixed-layer averages. To mitigate coastal ambiguities, we can enforce a high-fidelity land–ocean mask and, if desired, erode the coastline by one or two grid cells. We can also partition the domain (Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, equatorial band, subtropical gyre) and report subregional distributions and trends.
