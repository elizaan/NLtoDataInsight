What we show
I extracted a single high‑resolution snapshot of near‑surface salinity over the Bay of Bengal and mapped its horizontal gradient magnitude, along with isohalines and gradient directions, for 2020‑10‑02 06:00 UTC (dataset timestep 6150). The gradients are strongly filamentary and front‑like, with pronounced maxima along the eastern boundary (∼95–98°E, 8–15°N), east of the Andaman–Nicobar chain, and in a central north–south corridor around 92–95°E. Wakes and narrow coastal bands host clustered peaks. The basin interior shows lower to moderate gradients. A log‑scale histogram confirms a right‑skewed distribution: most of the area has modest gradients, while a smaller fraction contains sharp fronts.

Salinity and gradient magnitudes
For this snapshot, the masked near‑surface salinity spans 24.56–36.60 PSU (mean 33.39, std 0.74). The horizontal gradient magnitude |∇S| has a mean of 0.012 PSU/km, with a median of 0.006 PSU/km and a 90th percentile of 0.028 PSU/km. The map color scale was capped around 0.04 PSU/km to emphasize mesoscale structures; rare, much larger pointwise values up to ∼0.47 PSU/km occur at coast‑adjacent or highly contorted grid locations and should be treated as outliers.

How we did it and why
We used the DYAMOND LLC2160 salinity field at full resolution (quality Q=0) and read a Bay of Bengal subset corresponding to about 5.0–23.0°N and 80.0–100.0°E, selecting the surface layer only (z=[0,1]). To avoid heavy I/O on this petabyte‑scale dataset, we restricted the scope to one hourly timestep (6150) and a focused spatial window (x=[2832,3312], y=[4090,4575]), yielding 232,800 surface grid points. Land was masked using an LLC2160‑aligned land–ocean mask. Gradients were computed in physical units by applying numpy’s centered finite differences to the masked salinity and scaling by approximate metric factors derived from the subset’s latitude–longitude bounds (meters per degree at the subset’s central latitude). This lat/lon‑based metric is a reasonable local approximation, but the LLC2160 grid is not strictly rectilinear in geodetic space; we therefore interpret fine‑scale, near‑coast extremes with caution.

This configuration balances speed and fidelity for an exploratory “show me the gradients now” request: we preserve the original model signal (Q=0) and avoid temporal aliasing by choosing a single timestep, while keeping the domain small enough for interactive analysis. Empirical performance data support this choice: a nearby benchmark (CSV row 33) for a slightly larger surface subset at Q=0 reports 3.919 seconds (≈0.065 minutes) to read one timestep. Our subset has roughly one‑third the points, so the expected read time scales to about 1.3 seconds (≈0.02 minutes), leaving most of the wall‑clock time for gradient computation and plotting.

Why these plots
A gradient‑magnitude map immediately localizes frontal zones and filaments. Overlaying isohalines with gradient vectors shows how fronts align with salinity structure and eddy perimeters; arrows point toward increasing salinity, clarifying cross‑front orientation without conflating with currents. The histogram summarizes the field’s intermittency and tail behavior, making it easy to contrast “typical” background gradients (median ~0.006 PSU/km) with the energetic frontal subset (upper decile ~0.028 PSU/km).

Key patterns and context
The strongest features sit along the eastern margin and around the Andaman Sea, consistent with coastal freshwater–ocean interactions and boundary currents shearing along the island chain. The north–south corridor near 92–95°E exhibits tightly packed isohalines and eddy‑wrapped filaments, characteristic of mesoscale to submesoscale stirring. The comparatively quiescent western–central Bay has broad isohaline spacing and weaker |∇S|. The salinity range includes fresh signatures that are plausible for post‑monsoon conditions in early October, when riverine inputs and rainfall still imprint the northern and eastern shelves.

Estimated accuracy for this result
Because we used quality Q=0 (no spatial degradation), the salinity field we read matches the source IDX data to within machine precision. The empirical CSV corroborates this: every Q=0 row reports RMSE=0 and 0% error for the tested variable at full resolution (e.g., rows 21, 27, 33, 39). Scaling that to our request, the salinity values we plotted are a near‑perfect rendering of the model snapshot (<1% error).

The gradient magnitude is a derived diagnostic. Its numerical uncertainty is dominated not by data fidelity (Q=0) but by two methodological approximations: (i) using lat/lon‑based, constant grid spacing across the subset, and (ii) finite differencing near coastlines on an irregular LLC grid. Based on typical metric variability across this latitude band, a conservative estimate for |∇S| uncertainty is on the order of ±10–15%. Applying a 30% safety margin as requested yields an overall estimate of approximately ±13–20% for |∇S|. In absolute terms, that corresponds to roughly ±0.002 PSU/km for the mean (0.012 PSU/km) and ±0.004–0.006 PSU/km around the energetic upper decile (~0.028 PSU/km). These bounds reflect method and grid‑metric effects, not loss of information from downsampling.

Limitations and next steps
We analyzed one surface layer at one time; no vertical or temporal evolution is included. The grid‑metric approximation can overstate gradients in highly sheared coastal cells or around complex coastline geometry. For fully metric‑aware derivatives, we should use MITgcm’s curvilinear metrics (dxC, dyC) native to LLC2160 and compute dS/dx, dS/dy on the C‑grid. Robust post‑processing (e.g., coastline distance masks or small‑kernel median filters) would suppress spurious coastal outliers. Finally, pairing |∇S| with surface velocity (frontogenesis function, strain/vorticity partitioning) or tracking fronts across weeks would connect these structures to monsoon‑season freshwater export and eddy dynamics.

In short, the Bay of Bengal near‑surface salinity field on 2020‑10‑02 06:00 UTC exhibits sharp, filamentary gradients along the eastern boundary and around the Andaman–Nicobar archipelago, with widespread but weaker gradients elsewhere. The maps and histogram consistently point to a basin with intermittent, front‑rich structure at this time, captured at full model fidelity; the remaining uncertainty stems from metric approximations used in the gradient calculation.
